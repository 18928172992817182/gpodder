RedHat Linux / Fedora Core seem to use a custom version of GNU wget, at 
least as of early 2007. To overcome this problem, we're checking for both 
the "normal" wget output and RedHat/Fedora output so we can parse both 
variants for the speed string.

For more information, please look at the gpodder-devel archives of January 2007.

Ok, I dug into this and found the problem. It seems FC6 uses they're own 
version of wget (as you suspected). I don't know why they do this, the 
official GNU one is more informative in a terminal. 
I looked through libwget and reenacted it on the command line and these are my 
results (this is right before the regexp is tested against msg): 

Stock FC6 wget:
'500K .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........  1%  518K 84s'
Official GNU wget:
'700K .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........  2%  505.27 KB/s'
