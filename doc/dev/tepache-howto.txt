               Sam Dez 24 15:30:36 CET 2005  <thp@perli.net>

  This is a short howto on installing the "tepache" python script which 
  is used for sketching the GUI code for "gPodder". tepache has been 
  written by Sandino Flores Moreno and has been found somewhere on the 
  internet. The original URL from where thp got "tepache" isn't usable 
  anymore at the time of writing, so tepache has been included in the 
  source distribution of gPodder.

  Installation of "tepache":
    * copy the file "doc/dev/tepache" in the gPodder source distribution 
      somewhere into your path (for example, "~/bin" or "/usr/local/bin"
    * make sure the installed file has the right permissions and file 
      mode, by issuing "chmod 755 ~/bin/tepache" (or wherever you have 
      installed the tepache tool). If you install system-wide, it would 
      be a good idea to "chmod 0.0" the file (user and group set to root).
    * try it out: "tepache --version" should output "1.0"
