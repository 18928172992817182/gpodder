  VERY short gPodder i18n HOW-TO :)
  =================================

  to use i18n in gpodder, to the following in gPodder's dir:

  *) install dependencies listed in README
  *) run "make distclean"
  *) run "make generators"
  *) copy "data/messages.pot" to "data/po/XX.po",
     with "XX" being your iso lang code (example: "de")
  *) edit the "data/po/XX.po" file (translate the strings)
  *) run "make generators" again
  *) run "make test" to see if it works

  report any problems/bugs to: gpodder-devel@berlios.de
  
  KNOWN BUGS:
  *) installation of locale files when doing
     a "make install" not working
  *) should re-think the original strings in 
     source files, so this is likely to change in the future
  *) has had only minimal testing - there might be bugs..
