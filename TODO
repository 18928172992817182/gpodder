 * Suggestions by Marius Scurtescu <marius.scurtescu at gmail dot com>:
   - add more columns to the Available Podcasts tab (date, ...)
   - add the download progress to the same Available Podcasts tab and
     then you don't need the Download Status tab at all, this will allow
     you to see what is downloaded and what not
 
 * libipodsync
   -> check if ipod is connected (the automagic way)
   -> maybe delete podcasts that are deleted locally but still on ipod
   -> ............... :)
 
 * make libplayers more compliant with the fdo specification of .desktop files
  http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-0.9.4.html
 
 * do more translations (you can contribute here, of course :)
 
 * viewing pod info such as pubdate/description
   would've been nice.. It would give a better over view on your
   downloaded episodes.   (suggested by mattias@hedenskog.se)
   --> DONE on available podcasts, TODO on downloaded ones (trivial?)

 * Downloads  should be stored (at least optionally) in a
   directory that is not hidden. This will make the files 
   easier to find, for when one wants to copy the files to 
   a portable audio player or whatever.

   -> a "nice" symlink to the download dir in ~/Desktop option 
      has already been added to the properties dialog.  --thp
  
 * mark "currently downloading" episodes
   with different color (+ live update)
 
 * update "downloaded" (grey) episodes on download finish
   
 * (properties: set http proxy)          <--- done
   ---> or use gnome's proxy setting     <--- not done
   (suggested by alabrosse.ext@rd.francetelecom.fr)

 * sort view

 * maybe save date with downloads
 * maybe a "all channels view"

 * consider using "--continue" for wget
   (suggested by asjo@koldfront.dk>
