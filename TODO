 * i would like to have a button that will download all new files in all
   channels that are subscribed. An option in preferences that will
   autostart this process after startup would be also a nice feature :-)
      (suggested by Robert Pankowecki <robert.pankowecki     gmail.com>)

 * Make (at least optional) it possible to populate MP3 files' tags from 
   the metadata found in the feed. Possible options:
   
    -> Never populate MP3 files
    -> Only populate when MP3 files don't yet have tags
    -> Always populate; overwrite old tags if existing

   (Thanks to ubunt2@gmail.com for suggesting the metadata populate feat.)

 * Although downloads worked, as shown by presence in channel directory
   on hard disk and by playing the pod with RealPlayer, the pods didn't
   always show up in the 'downloaded' tab. When the downloaded podcast
   did show up in the 'downloaded' tab, it did once I closed and
   re-opened gPodder.    (thanks to Haim Roitgrund for reporting this)
 
 * re-factor "if libgpodder.isDebugging()" + "print" into a more 
   sophisticated logging/debugging infrastructure (the code should 
   not "print" debug messages, but hand the debug strings to the 
   logging facility, something like:  libgpodder.debug( "bla bla")

 * in libipodsync.py: use mime magic instead of extension-based 
   video detection? --> also, is mp4 always video or could it be 
   aac audio too? if so, how to check what is what?
   
   according to http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=62723, 
   mp4 files can be both audio and video files.. m4v and m4a are wrong 
   extensions introduced by apple.. maybe a stripped-down mime magic 
   detection could do the trick? (we only need to detect the file types 
   supported by ipods, after all.. mp3, aac, wav, mov, mp4-video, ..?)

 * The only thing that I can't seem to find is the ability to have 
   gpodder only download the latest podcast when running it at the 
   command line (gpodder -r).  Currently after subscribing to a cast 
   it will download all of them.  (suggested by Stephen, urban@inetdesign.org)

 * gpodder doesn't start if somebody has messed with the channels.xml file
   (or if you send the channels.xml to somebody -- greetings to steve :)

 * Suggestion by Marius Scurtescu <marius.scurtescu at gmail dot com>:
   - add the download progress to the same Available Podcasts tab and
     then you don't need the Download Status tab at all, this will allow
     you to see what is downloaded and what not
 
 * libipodsync
   -> maybe delete podcasts that are deleted locally but still on ipod
 
 * do more translations (you can contribute here, of course :)
 
 * Downloads  should be stored (at least optionally) in a
   directory that is not hidden. This will make the files 
   easier to find, for when one wants to copy the files to 
   a portable audio player or whatever.
                       (suggested by leogomez@gmail.com)
   -> a "nice" symlink to the download dir in ~/Desktop option 
      has already been added to the properties dialog.  --thp
  
 * mark "currently downloading" episodes
   with different color (+ live update)
 
 * update "downloaded" (grey) episodes on download finish
   
 * sort view

 * maybe a "all channels view"

 * consider using "--continue" for wget
   (suggested by asjo@koldfront.dk>
