  == 0.6 release-critical ==

 (none so far)

  == 0.6 or afterwards ==
  
 * generate a Debian package (for Debian Sarge & Ubuntu Breezy)

 * maybe mark "currently downloading" episodes
   with different color (+ live update)
   
 * check if threads deleted from download status
   list make the gui freeze and why and FIX ;)

 * (properties: set http proxy)          <--- done
   ---> or use gnome's proxy setting     <--- not done
   (suggested by alabrosse.ext@rd.francetelecom.fr)

 * sort view
 * improve error handler

 * maybe save date with downloads
 * maybe a "all channels view"
