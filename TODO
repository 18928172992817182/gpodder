 === Todo List for gPodder ===

 * Now for a genuine feature request: a search box?
                                  (Michel Salim; michel.salim gmail.com)

 * Finally, could it mark via a different color code when a podcast
   has been played. (John Connor; johnc.connor gmail.com)

 * First, please don't use hard coded background colors when you use the
   foreground color from the current gtk theme at the same time. Right now
   you assume people always have a theme with dark text color, which is
   just not true. My theme uses a bright text color and that makes the
   podcasts list unreadable, which uses yellow/white as background. Also
   think about people using gnomes highcontrast inverse theme (white text
   color). (suggested by Holger Bauer -- umarmung@email.de)

 * My second suggestion is to include a systray icon similar to the ones
   many music players have. It would be great if I could hide/show the
   gpodder window by clicking on it. Getting current download status on
   mouseover would be amazing. Being notified when a download finished
   either by status icon or notification popup would be the ne plus
   ultra. :)   (suggested by Holger Bauer -- umarmung@email.de)

 * Also, is there an automated way to keep only the most recent X episodes?
   (suggested by Andy -- apblist@speakeasy.net)

 * the sync command seems to be a one-way transfer. It doesn't seem to delete
   from the iPod the episodes that have been deleted in gpodder.  Sure, I 
   can use the "clean up" command, which seems to delete all of them, and 
   then sync, but that's a lot of extra disk activity.
   (suggested by Andy -- apblist@speakeasy.net)

 * libipodsync
   -> maybe delete podcasts that are deleted locally but still on ipod
 
 * My favourite Videocast offers 3gp-Files (for mobiles) and m4v-Files 
   (for iPods) in his feed.gPodder loads the low quality m4v-File, which 
   is not only low quality, kaffeine can't even play it.  How can I 
   change the behaviour to load the m4-File?  Maybe a list with filetype
   priorities would help. (suggested by Timm Preetz <timm -- preetz us>)

 * In preferences dialog, have two choices for programs (one for video 
   podcasts, one for audio podcasts)
                   (suggested by Philipp Ottlinger, otg@aiki-it.de)

 -------------------------

 * Make (at least optional) it possible to populate MP3 files' tags from 
   the metadata found in the feed. Possible options:
   
    -> Never populate MP3 files
    -> Only populate when MP3 files don't yet have tags
    -> Always populate; overwrite old tags if existing

   (Thanks to ubunt2@gmail.com for suggesting the metadata populate feat.)

 * in libipodsync.py: use mime magic instead of extension-based 
   video detection? --> also, is mp4 always video or could it be 
   aac audio too? if so, how to check what is what?
   
   according to http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=62723, 
   mp4 files can be both audio and video files.. m4v and m4a are wrong 
   extensions introduced by apple.. maybe a stripped-down mime magic 
   detection could do the trick? (we only need to detect the file types 
   supported by ipods, after all.. mp3, aac, wav, mov, mp4-video, ..?)

 * Suggestion by Marius Scurtescu <marius.scurtescu at gmail dot com>:
   - add the download progress to the same Available Podcasts tab and
     then you don't need the Download Status tab at all, this will allow
     you to see what is downloaded and what not
