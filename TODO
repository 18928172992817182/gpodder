 * in libipodsync.py: use mime magic instead of extension-based 
   video detection? --> also, is mp4 always video or could it be 
   aac audio too? if so, how to check what is what?
   
   according to http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=62723, 
   mp4 files can be both audio and video files.. m4v and m4a are wrong 
   extensions introduced by apple.. maybe a stripped-down mime magic 
   detection could do the trick? (we only need to detect the file types 
   supported by ipods, after all.. mp3, aac, wav, mov, mp4-video, ..?)

 * The only thing that I can't seem to find is the ability to have 
   gpodder only download the latest podcast when running it at the 
   command line (gpodder -r).  Currently after subscribing to a cast 
   it will download all of them.  (suggested by Stephen, urban@inetdesign.org)

 * gpodder doesn't start if somebody has messed with the channels.xml file
   (or if you send the channels.xml to somebody -- greetings to steve :)

 * Suggestions by Marius Scurtescu <marius.scurtescu at gmail dot com>:
   - add more columns to the Available Podcasts tab (date, ...)
   - add the download progress to the same Available Podcasts tab and
     then you don't need the Download Status tab at all, this will allow
     you to see what is downloaded and what not
 
 * libipodsync
   -> check if ipod is connected (the automagic way)
   -> maybe delete podcasts that are deleted locally but still on ipod
   -> ............... :)
 
 * do more translations (you can contribute here, of course :)
 
 * viewing pod info such as pubdate/description
   would've been nice.. It would give a better over view on your
   downloaded episodes.   (suggested by mattias@hedenskog.se)
   --> DONE on available podcasts, TODO on downloaded ones (trivial?)

 * Downloads  should be stored (at least optionally) in a
   directory that is not hidden. This will make the files 
   easier to find, for when one wants to copy the files to 
   a portable audio player or whatever.

   -> a "nice" symlink to the download dir in ~/Desktop option 
      has already been added to the properties dialog.  --thp
  
 * mark "currently downloading" episodes
   with different color (+ live update)
 
 * update "downloaded" (grey) episodes on download finish
   
 * (properties: set http proxy)          <--- done
   ---> or use gnome's proxy setting     <--- not done
   (suggested by alabrosse.ext@rd.francetelecom.fr)

 * sort view

 * maybe save date with downloads
 * maybe a "all channels view"

 * consider using "--continue" for wget
