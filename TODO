 * viewing pod info such as pubdate/description
   would've been nice.. It would give a better over view on your
   downloaded episodes.   (suggested by mattias@hedenskog.se)
   --> DONE on available podcasts, TODO on downloaded ones (trivial?)

 * Downloads  should be stored (at least optionally) in a
   directory that is not hidden. This will make the files 
   easier to find, for when one wants to copy the files to 
   a portable audio player or whatever.
                       (suggested by leogomez@gmail.com)
   -> maybe a "nice" symlink to the download dir in ~/Desktop?  --thp
  
 * generate a Debian package (for Debian Sarge & Ubuntu Breezy)

 * maybe mark "currently downloading" episodes
   with different color (+ live update)
   
 * check if threads deleted from download status
   list make the gui freeze and why and FIX ;)

 * (properties: set http proxy)          <--- done
   ---> or use gnome's proxy setting     <--- not done
   (suggested by alabrosse.ext@rd.francetelecom.fr)

 * sort view
 * improve error handler

 * maybe save date with downloads
 * maybe a "all channels view"

 ** UTILIZE PYTHON-FEEDPARSER (maybe..)

 * consider using "--continue" for wget
   (suggested by asjo@koldfront.dk>
