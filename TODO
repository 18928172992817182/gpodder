 === Todo List for gPodder ===

 * It really bugs me how I have to wait half a minute every time I start
   gPodder while my feeds are updating. Wouldn't it be better if you'd let
   the feeds update in the background? You could, perhaps, place a status
   bar at the bottom of the window to display the progress instead.
   
                    (suggested by Pieter De Decker (pdedecker gmail com)

 * Would it be possible to implement a "delete all from all channels"
   feature?  I'm finding myself downloading episodes, sending them to my
   iPod, and then handling deletion via gtkpod.

                    (suggested by Andy Busch (buschap at speakeasy.net)

 * It would be great if gpodder supported (either through preferences or 
   through an addition to the device list) the ability to synchronize only 
   unplayed podcasts or the last "x" number of unplayed podcasts. This is a 
   feature that is currently supported by iTunes and would be of great help 
   for persons with limited free space on their devices or massive podcast 
   collections.

      -> partially done (unplayed podcasts as an option)

                   -- suggested by Stephan Buys <stephan.buys@gmail.com>

 * I think it would be nice if gPodder had a color indicator (like it 
   already has for downloaded/deleted episodes) for podcasts that haven't 
   been transferred to the device yet. What do you think? Is this possible?
                               (Pieter De Decker, pdedecker gmail.com)

 * Utilize DesktopEntry in python-xdg for libplayers

 * Now for a genuine feature request: a search box?
       -> partially implemented (search-as-you-type in available episodes)
                                  (Michel Salim; michel.salim gmail.com)

 * My second suggestion is to include a systray icon similar to the ones
   many music players have. It would be great if I could hide/show the
   gpodder window by clicking on it. Getting current download status on
   mouseover would be amazing. Being notified when a download finished
   either by status icon or notification popup would be the ne plus
   ultra. :)   (suggested by Holger Bauer -- umarmung@email.de)

 * Also, is there an automated way to keep only the most recent X episodes?
   (suggested by Andy -- apblist@speakeasy.net)

 * the sync command seems to be a one-way transfer. It doesn't seem to delete
   from the iPod the episodes that have been deleted in gpodder.  Sure, I 
   can use the "clean up" command, which seems to delete all of them, and 
   then sync, but that's a lot of extra disk activity.
   (suggested by Andy -- apblist@speakeasy.net)

 * libipodsync
   -> maybe delete podcasts that are deleted locally but still on ipod
 
 * My favourite Videocast offers 3gp-Files (for mobiles) and m4v-Files 
   (for iPods) in his feed.gPodder loads the low quality m4v-File, which 
   is not only low quality, kaffeine can't even play it.  How can I 
   change the behaviour to load the m4-File?  Maybe a list with filetype
   priorities would help. (suggested by Timm Preetz <timm -- preetz us>)

 * In preferences dialog, have two choices for programs (one for video 
   podcasts, one for audio podcasts)
                   (suggested by Philipp Ottlinger, otg@aiki-it.de)

 -------------------------

 * Make (at least optional) it possible to populate MP3 files' tags from 
   the metadata found in the feed. Possible options:
   
    -> Never populate MP3 files
    -> Only populate when MP3 files don't yet have tags
    -> Always populate; overwrite old tags if existing

    (partially implemented already)

   (Thanks to ubunt2@gmail.com for suggesting the metadata populate feat.)

 * in libipodsync.py: use mime magic instead of extension-based 
   video detection? --> also, is mp4 always video or could it be 
   aac audio too? if so, how to check what is what?
   
   according to http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=62723, 
   mp4 files can be both audio and video files.. m4v and m4a are wrong 
   extensions introduced by apple.. maybe a stripped-down mime magic 
   detection could do the trick? (we only need to detect the file types 
   supported by ipods, after all.. mp3, aac, wav, mov, mp4-video, ..?)

 * Suggestion by Marius Scurtescu <marius.scurtescu at gmail dot com>:
   - add the download progress to the same Available Podcasts tab and
     then you don't need the Download Status tab at all, this will allow
     you to see what is downloaded and what not

     -> we have a icon for "download in progress" podcasts now
