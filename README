 gPodder 0.5 README
 ==================
 Copyright (c) 2005-2006 Thomas Perl <thp@perli.net>
 Version 0.5 released on 04.02.2006 under the GNU GPL
 This version includes a patch from 05.02.2006.




 ============================
 1) What's new in version 0.6
 ============================

 Please see the gPodder homepage for most recent information.
 
 Highlights of this release include:
  * Object-oriented code
  * Lightweight dependencies
  * Improved user interface (GUI)
  * Displaying titles instead of URLs
  * Simultaneous downloads (in a new download list!)
  * XML-based local database
  * Real parsing of RSS files now ("the XML way")
  * New features and new bugs - included!

 ===============
 2) Dependencies
 ===============

 Debian/Ubuntu users can install the dependencies with:
 
   apt-get install python python-glade2 python-gtk2 wget

 Other users: Please install the above packages somehow ;)
 If you want to install gPodder from source, you have to 
 get the following packages:
 
   apt-get install help2man
 
 =====================
 3) How to run/install
 =====================

 Extract the tar archive somewhere into your home directory and cd into 
 the directory where you extracted it, for example:

   tar xzvf gpodder-0.5.tar.gz
   cd gpodder-0.5/
 
 After that you can start gPodder 0.5 by starting it with the following 
 command:

   make test
 
 If this works out, close gPodder again and install it system-wide:

   sudo make install

 This will install gPodder in standard locations. After the installation 
 routine (hopefully) finished successfully, you might run gPodder from 
 any path on your machine by simply typing:

   gpodder

 If you have any problems, please visit the gPodder website or mail the 
 gPodder mailing list (see below for more information).

 =============
 4) How to use
 =============

 gPodder was designed with usability in mind. Saying that gPodder is 
 self-explaining saves me from writing long documentation. Watch out 
 for the gPodder website. If you need more information, please mail 
 our gPodder mailing list :)

 =============
 5) Known bugs
 =============

 No known bug so far. Please mail the mailing list or the author directly 
 to report bugs - we'll try to fix them in the next release :) Thanks!

 =========================================
