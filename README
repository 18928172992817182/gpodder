 [ DEPENDENCIES ]

    - Python 2.6 or newer              http://python.org/
    - Feedparser 5.0.1 or newer        http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/
    - mygpoclient 1.4 or newer         http://thp.io/2010/mygpoclient/
    - Python D-Bus bindings

    gPodder is still compatible with Python 2.5, but you might need to
    install sqlite3 and json ("simplejson") manually. We reserve the
    right to drop support for Python 2.5 in future point releases.

    As an alternative to python-dbus on Mac OS X and Windows, you can use
    the dummy (no-op) D-Bus module provided in "tools/fake-dbus-module/".


 [ GTK UI - ADDITIONAL DEPENDENCIES ]

    - PyGTK 2.12 or newer              http://pygtk.org/


 [ QML UI - ADDITIONAL DEPENDENCIES ]

    - Qt 4.7.1 or newer                http://qt.nokia.com/
    - PySide 1.0.8 or newer            http://www.pyside.org/
    - Qt Mobility 1.2 or newer         http://qt.nokia.com/
    - Qt Quick Components              http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-components

    The QML UI depends on the QtMultimediaKit QML bindings for playing
    back audio (libdeclarative-multimedia in Debian).

    The QML UI now also depends on Qt Quick Components. On MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan,
    these components are pre-installed. You can install them on your Desktop by
    checking out the code from the qt-components Git repository.

    You might also need to copy the theme from /usr/share/themes/blanco/ on a
    MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan device to your development machine in order for all UI
    elements to be displayed correctly.


 [ OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES ]

    - Bluetooth file sending: gnome-obex-send or bluetooth-sendto
    - HTML shownotes: python-webkit
    - Size detection on Windows: PyWin32
    - Native OS X support: ige-mac-integration


 [ BUILD DEPENDENCIES ]

    - help2man
    - intltool


 [ TEST DEPENDENCIES ]

    - python-minimock
    - python-coverage


 [ RUNNING AND INSTALLATION ]

    To run gPodder from source, use "bin/gpodder".

    To install gPodder system-wide, use "make install".


 [ PYTHON 3 SUPPORT ]

    The CLI version of gPodder (bin/gpo) is compatible with Python 3
    after converting the codebase with the 2to3 utility:

      2to3 -w bin/* src/gpodder/

    You will also need a copy of "mygpoclient" converted using 2to3 and
    a copy of "feedparser" converted using 2to3 (see the feedparser README
    for details on how to get it set up on Python 3, including sgmllib).

    Please note that the Gtk UI is not compatible with Python 3 (it will
    be once we migrate the codebase to Gtk3/GObject Introspection), and
    the QML UI - while theoretically compatible - has not been tested
    with Python 3 yet due to the Python 3 support status in PySide.

    As of January 2012, Python 3 support is still experimental. Please
    report any bugs that you find to the gPodder bug tracker (see below).


 [ PORTABLE MODE / ROAMING PROFILES ]

    The run-time environment variable GPODDER_HOME is used to set
    the location for storing the database and downloaded files.

    This can be used for multiple configurations or to store the
    download directory directly on a MP3 player or USB disk:

        export GPODDER_HOME=/media/usbdisk/gpodder-data/
