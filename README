 ============================
 1) What's new in version 0.7
 ============================

 There's been MUCH work going on in gPodder 0.7, and you can clearly 
 see the improvements. For more information, look at the gPodder homepage.
 
 Highlights of this release include:
  * Very stable download handling - finally
  * Graphical selection of audio players that are installed on system
  * Internationalization support! (German and French supported at the moment)
  * iTunes image ("Cover") support in the channel editor
  * Better handling of malformed (or complicated) XML RSS feeds
  * iPod synchronization support (Yay!) - requires optional libraries
  * Code clean-ups and refinements
  * New features and new bugs - included!

 ===============
 2) Dependencies
 ===============

 Debian/Ubuntu users can install the dependencies with:
 
   apt-get install python python-glade2 python-gtk2 wget python-xml
 
 If you want to have iPod synchronization support, you will also 
 have to install the following OPTIONAL packages:

   * python-eyed3 (eyeD3 Python bindings)
   * python-gpod (libgpod's Python bindings)

 Other users: Please install the above packages somehow ;)
 If you want to install gPodder from source, you have to 
 get the following packages:
 
   apt-get install help2man python-dev intltool
 
 =====================
 3) How to run/install
 =====================

 Extract the tar archive somewhere into your home directory and cd into 
 the directory where you extracted it, for example:

   tar xzvf gpodder-0.7.tar.gz
   cd gpodder-0.7/
 
 After that you can start gPodder by starting it with the following 
 command:

   make test
 
 If this works out, close gPodder again and install it system-wide:

   sudo make install

 This will install gPodder in standard locations. After the installation 
 routine (hopefully) finished successfully, you might run gPodder from 
 any path on your machine by simply typing:

   gpodder

 If you have any problems, please visit the gPodder website or mail the 
 gPodder mailing list (see below for more information).

 =============
 4) How to use
 =============

 gPodder was designed with usability in mind. Saying that gPodder is 
 self-explaining saves me from writing long documentation. Watch out 
 for the gPodder website. If you need more information, please mail 
 our gPodder mailing list :)

 =============
 5) Known bugs
 =============

 No known bug so far. Please mail the mailing list or the author directly 
 to report bugs - we'll try to fix them in the next release :) Thanks!

 =========================================
 6) Feature requests, bug reports, patches

 anything that comes to your mind relating gPodder:
