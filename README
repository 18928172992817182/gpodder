 gPodder 0.5 README
 ==================
 Copyright (c) 2005 Thomas Perl <thp@perli.net>
 Released on 31.10.2005 under the GNU GPL


 ============================
 1) What's new in version 0.5
 ============================

 please see the gPodder homepage for most recent information.

 gPodder 0.5 is a pre-release snapshot of the upcoming 0.6 release.

 ===============
 2) Dependencies
 ===============

 Debian/Ubuntu users can install the dependencies with:
 
   apt-get install python python-glade2 python-gtk2 wget

 Other users: Please install the above packages somehow ;)

 =====================
 3) How to run/install
 =====================

 Extract the tar archive somewhere into your home directory and cd into 
 the directory where you extracted it, for example:

   tar xzvf gpodder-0.5-pre.tar.gz
   cd gpodder-0.5-pre/
 
 After that you can start gPodder 0.5 by starting it with the following 
 command:

   ./gpodder-run
 
 Currently there is no way to automatically install it system-wide, but 
 if you are whiz enough you will figure out how to do it anyway - if not, 
 you can always write an e-mail to me :)

 =============
 4) How to use
 =============

 gPodder was designed with usability in mind. Saying that gPodder is 
 self-explaining saves me from writing long documentation. Will write some 
 more documentation for the 0.6 relese.

 =============
 5) Known bugs
 =============

 Here is a short list of known bugs which i (or someone else) will fix 
 soon hopefully:

   *) Who has seen the "downloaded podcasts" screen?
   *) Some more code coolness
   *) Preferences dialog
   *) Export channel list
   *) YOUR FEATURE REQUEST/BUG REPORT HERE

 =========================================
 6) Feature requests, bug reports, patches
 =========================================

 Feel free to mail me about feature requests, bug reports, patches or nearly
 anything that comes to your mind relating gPodder:

   eMail: thp@perli.net

 Last but not least... have fun with gPodder :)
