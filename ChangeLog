Last batch of experimental change merges (up to svn r398)

	* doc/dev/tepache-howto.txt: Removed
	* doc/dev/tepache: Removed
	* src/gpodder/gui.py.orig: Removed
	* src/gpodder/libwget.py: Send progress = 0.0 on inital status update
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Try to get episode metadata from several
	different properties of the corresponding feedparser entries; warn
	user when we couldn't get the episode title and try to get the episode
	title from the filename of the URL if we still have not found an
	episode title
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Add get_device_name() that returns a
	"nice" representative string of the currently selected device that can
	be used to represent the device in the GUI
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Return "(unknown)" string when bytesize in
	format_filesize() when the size has a negative value; make
	get_tree_icon() catch errors and be more corrent with icon creation;
	add get_first_line() function that extracts the first line of a string
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Add "divx" to list of video extensions
	* src/gpodder/services.py: DownloadStatusManager has a new observer
	notification: "progress-detail"; add unregister() functionality for
	observers; add request_progress_detail() function that can be used to
	force a "progress-detail" notification to be sent out to all relevant
	observers; remove get_url_by_iter() function as it is not needed
	anymore
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Clean-up after tepache dependency removal; new
	GladeWidget base class that subclasses SimpleGladeApp and simplifies
	class creation for our gPodder windows; add context menu to
	treeAvailable; re-work play_or_download() and make it return a list of
	boolean indicators on which actions can be performed on the selected
	items; move show_message() and show_confirmation() to GladeWidget;
	disable editing of the URL in the channel info dialog, this simplifies
	code and editing the URL doesn't make so much sense anyway (adding the
	new url and removing the old does the same and is easier, code-wise);
	add support for cancelling downloads in the available podcasts view;
	support live status view and download cancelling in the gPodderEpisode
	dialog window by hooking up to DownloadStatusManager as observer
	* src/gpodder/SimpleGladeApp.py: Customize for gPodder (remove usage
	of weakref for keyword arguments -> properties of new object)
	* bin/gpodder: We're using a experimental development version now
	* data/gpodder.glade: Add progress bar and associated buttons to
	gPodderEpisode dialog
	* MANIFEST.in: Removed gpodder.py.orig inclusion
	* Makefile: Removed support for tepache
