Limit download progress status updates to reduce CPU load

	* src/gpodder/download.py: Limit the amount of status updates the
	download threads send to the DownloadStatusManager to one per second;
	this should make gPodder less CPU-intensive with many parallel
	downloads; thanks to Wilfred van Rooijen for reporting and testing

Tue, 02 Oct 2007 17:59:29 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Update channel models (icons) after iPod synchronization

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Call update_model() on each channel after an
	iPod sync, so we can update the played state on the available episodes
	lists when played state was changed by the iPod sync

Sat, 29 Sep 2007 14:12:15 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Fix loading of channel metadata (load auth data and settings)

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Load channel metadata when loading a
	podcastChannel object from OPML/LocalDB. This fixes a problem with
	authentication data being not loaded and also fixes a bug when the
	custom-set channel title was not correctly used throughout the GUI.
	Thanks to Nick (nikosapi) for reporting and providing a patch

Tue, 25 Sep 2007 22:02:19 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Finally remove Desktop symlink code; several compatibility fixes

	* src/gpodder/download.py: Prevent divide-by-zero errors when
	calculating download speed
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Prevent divide-by-zero errors when calculating
	percentage done in code for moving the downloaded items folder
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Remove the "Symlink on Desktop" code,
	because it's not GUI-accessible anymore and we didn't use it anyway
	* src/gpodder/opml.py: Better local filename detection by using
	os.path.exists() instead of .startswith('/'); this is also good for
	cross-platform compatibility where parts don't usually start with a
	forward slash (i.e. Win32)

Mon, 24 Sep 2007 00:09:44 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Channel list selection bug fixes

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Fix some channel list-related problems and
	annoyances, based on a patch by Nick (nikosapi)
	* bin/gpodder: We're in development again, so "+svn"

Fri, 21 Sep 2007 02:07:43 +0200 <thp@perli.net>

Fri, 21 Sep 2007 01:46:38 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Fix problems with path selection in treeChannels

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Simple bugfix

Fri, 21 Sep 2007 00:32:51 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Center gPodderEpisode on treeAvailable for less mouse hopping

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: If possible, center the gPodderEpisode dialog
	window on the treeAvailable, because that makes the position of the
	opened dialog more predictable and easier to use (as if the
	gPodderEpisode dialog was "inside" the treeView from which it opened)

Fri, 21 Sep 2007 00:07:49 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Don't translate feed format string examples

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Don't mark format string examples as
	translatable

Wed, 19 Sep 2007 17:21:09 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Small bugfix for updating treeChannels when its model changes

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Bugfix

Wed, 19 Sep 2007 16:57:41 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Removed channel combobox, drag'n'drop improvements + new channel cover editor

	* data/gpodder.glade: Remove comboAvailable in gPodder (main window);
	add download+clear button in gPodderChannel, rename some items that
	are now used in code; make the channel navigator non-shrinkable (so
	it is always visible, because we don't have comboAvailable anymore)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Remove support for the channel combo box,
	also known as comboAvailable; clean-up DND code and make treeChannels
	the only DND target in the main window; remove some unnecessary
	updating of the channel list (calls to updateComboBox);
	Changes for the gPodderChannel dialog: Don't automatically download
	channel cover when dialog pops up; add "Download" and "Clear" buttons
	to the cover editor; add DND support for dropping local files or
	images from the web browser to the cover editor (for setting custom
	covers on channels with bad or no cover)
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Don't abort get_image_from_url() if the
	URL is invalid, but the image has already been downloaded (because we
	read the downloaded image in the code when it exists, without URL)

Wed, 19 Sep 2007 14:23:40 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Center feed update dialog on main window; scroll reset in chan.navigator
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Reset the current scroll position of the channel
	navigator when re-loading the channel list; this fixes an annoyance
	that Alistair Sutton <alistair.sutton@gmail.com> reported when dealing
	with a HUGE channel list (more than 50 channels); also removed the
	scroll position reset code from treeAvailable, as we already managed
	to only edit the model instead of re-loading it every time; added code
	to really center the feed update dialog on gPodder's main window

Tue, 18 Sep 2007 20:15:56 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Replace wget with new gpodder.download module; User-agent support

	for wget, as this is not needed anymore
	* src/gpodder/cache.py: Clean-up; remove old logging code; add support
	for gpodder.user_agent; log info when there is an error in parsing the
	feed, so the user knows why this feed is not cached
	* src/gpodder/console.py: Remove DownloadPool, Use new
	gpodder.download module for carrying out downloads, remove
	wget_version() tester, as this is not needed anymore =)
	* src/gpodder/download.py: Added new downloader module that uses
	urllib and some custom classes and functions to provide the equivalent
	functionality of the obsolete "libwget", but without the wget
	dependency and with better accuracy (progress reporting, etc..)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Utilize new gpodder.download module instead of
	libwget
	* src/gpodder/__init__.py: Add "user_agent" variable to the gpodder
	module that holds the value of the "User-agent" header to send to web
	servers when requesting OPMLs, Feeds or download data
	* src/gpodder/opml.py: Add support for sending the User-agent header
	* src/gpodder/services.py: Make the progress column a float column to
	have smoother progress indicuation; add the "acquired" keyword
	argument to s_release(); default 'speed' to a translated "Queued"
	* src/gpodder/libwget.py: Removed
	* doc/dev/redhat-wget-output.txt: Removed

	* src/gpodder/cache.py: Add support for "offline" keyword argument
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Make intelligent use of "offline" keyword
	argument when passed to load_channels(); simplify code for selecting

	argument in all relevant function calls

Sat, 15 Sep 2007 16:22:28 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
New LocalDB using DOM (removes python-xml dependency); channel context menu

	the dependency on python-xml has been removed with this release
	* data/gpodder.glade: Remove the "info" button for the current channel
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Remove localdb-related code and adopt code for

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Merge code from old liblocaldb and
	liblocdbreader/liblocdbwriter to this module as LocalDBWriter and
	LocalDBReader; customize podcastChannel to new LocalDB code
	* src/gpodder/libwget.py: Remove localdb-specific code (now obsolete)

Wed, 12 Sep 2007 23:07:23 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Fix a bug when traversing directories with loop symlinks

	* src/gpodder/util.py: Don't dive into subdirectories that are
	symbolic links, this is to avoid a situation where looping symlinks
	result in the function dead-locking in a endless recursive loop,
	thanks to Bjørn Rasmussen <bjoernr@sensewave.com> for pointing that
	out and providing the necessary bug report to fix this issue

Sun, 09 Sep 2007 18:47:20 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Mark episodes as downloaded/deleted when deleting episodes

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Rename "Mark [...] as downloaded" to "Mark [...]

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Fix problem when trying to delete
	episodes that have not been downloaded

Sat, 08 Sep 2007 16:45:21 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Support for customized file names in MP3 player sync code

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add supporting code for reading/setting
	configuration options for the preferences dialog and a help display
	code that displays a guide on how to write custom sync name strings
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: New configuration options:
	custom_sync_name (holds format string) and
	custom_sync_name_enabled (boolean, if the above string should be used)
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Use custom sync name format string and
	util's object_string_formatter() function to obtain a file name for
	the synchronized episode (or default to episode.title if disabled)
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add new property methods to podcastItem:
	basename (returns the basename of the URL, without extension) and
	published (returns the pubDate of the episode in YYYYMMDD format)

Sun, 02 Sep 2007 14:23:17 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
More sanitizing hacks for ugly feeds we don't really like

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Negotiate which enclosure to select from
	multiple enclosures, if there are more than one available; skip
	episodes with a buggy download URL (i.e. no supported URL scheme)
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Return "(unknown)" if file size cannot be
	determined from the string passed to format_filesize(); return "None"
	in file_type_by_extension() if the extension is an empty string

Fri, 31 Aug 2007 23:38:01 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Handle enclosures (or lack thereof) better if fields are missing

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Remove refetch_channel_list() function, as this
	is not called anywhere from the code (uh, how did i miss that?)
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Be more liberal to enclosure tags
	without length or mime type; ignore episodes without enclosures (it's
	not len(enclosures) == 0, but the enclosures attribute doesn't even
	exist on entries without enclosures, so make sure to check for that

Fri, 31 Aug 2007 20:03:03 +0200 <thp@perli.net>

Thu, 30 Aug 2007 21:06:28 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Dependency check for python-feedparser in bin/gpodder

	* bin/gpodder: Add dependency check and warning (with exit) if
	python-feedparser is not installed, as python-feedparser now is a
	dependency of gPodder

Thu, 30 Aug 2007 20:51:46 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Support for modifying DownloadHistory and PlaybackHistory in GUI

	* doc/dev/tepache-howto.txt: Removed
	* doc/dev/tepache: Removed
	* src/gpodder/gui.py.orig: Removed
	* src/gpodder/libwget.py: Send progress = 0.0 on inital status update
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Try to get episode metadata from several
	different properties of the corresponding feedparser entries; warn
	user when we couldn't get the episode title and try to get the episode
	title from the filename of the URL if we still have not found an
	episode title
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Add get_device_name() that returns a
	"nice" representative string of the currently selected device that can
	be used to represent the device in the GUI
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Return "(unknown)" string when bytesize in
	format_filesize() when the size has a negative value; make
	get_tree_icon() catch errors and be more corrent with icon creation;
	add get_first_line() function that extracts the first line of a string
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Add "divx" to list of video extensions
	* src/gpodder/services.py: DownloadStatusManager has a new observer
	notification: "progress-detail"; add unregister() functionality for
	observers; add request_progress_detail() function that can be used to
	force a "progress-detail" notification to be sent out to all relevant
	observers; remove get_url_by_iter() function as it is not needed

	code and editing the URL doesn't make so much sense anyway (adding the
	new url and removing the old does the same and is easier, code-wise);
	add support for cancelling downloads in the available podcasts view;
	support live status view and download cancelling in the gPodderEpisode
	dialog window by hooking up to DownloadStatusManager as observer
